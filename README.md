#Task4 - E-Commerce Dataset SQL Analysis

Hi! This is my submission for Task 4 of the Data Analyst Internship – focused on SQL-based data exploration on an e-commerce dataset using **Google Colab** and **SQLite**. Here’s a summary of what I did:

-Used SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, and GROUP BY to filter, sort, and group data
-Applied aggregate functions like COUNT, SUM, AVG, and MAX to analyze:
  -Total events by type
  -Most active users
  -Average and total prices per brand/category
-Wrote subqueries to compare products priced above average
-Created a view to summarize brand-wise statistics
-Performed a self-join to track user event flow within sessions

## Tools Used
- Google Colab
- SQLite (in-memory)
- Python (Pandas, sqlite3)
  
This task strengthened my ability to write clean SQL, interpret results, and use SQL for real-world business analysis.

Thank you for reviewing my work!
